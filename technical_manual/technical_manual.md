## Introduction

### Overview 
For our Third Year Project we decided to design a POS Application, which we called Order 66. Order 66 is an application aimed at restaurants, bars and cafes that will accompany and in the future replace your current till system. Order 66 uses a Website admin interface which will allow an employer create the menu for their restaurant/bar/cafe, add all the employee details so they can easily manage their accounts, automatically create reports, and lastly have access to helpful usage statistics. Employees can also download our Android Application which will allow employees to create orders using the menu their employer has created and send orders so all other employees can view them and start preparing them seconds after it has been sent.

Order 66 has many benefits for both the employer and the employee as it can help improve efficiency in the workplace which can in turn can provide greater returns for the employer. Not to mention making the employees life that much easier as they will not have to worry about forgetting what was in each order, what order went to what table and notify coworkers about the last order. 

### Business Context

The aim for this project is to provide an alternative option for current POS services with something that is tailored to the needs of your business allowing for a more efficient and productive service which in turn should increase sales.

The app will also have great scope for analytics and will allow the owner to determine where the inefficiencies lie in their business.

## System Architecture

For this project we used a library called Boostrap to design our Website as the framework help making the process of creating a responsive Website much simpler as it uses the Grid System over the more traditional Box Model. 
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

Another library we used was Google's Chart library to create all the different graphs and charts as it is a very well documented library that is easy to use.
[Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/)

The Entity-Relationship Diagram below outlines our implemented database design, it also shows the Primary and Foreign keys in each table.

## High-Level Design

Our android application requires an Internet connection to function as it uses HTTP POST requests to run PHP scrips on a server. Each script then uses SQL querys to query our SQL Database which store all of our user information and insert or pull any required information, which then updates on the users Android Device. Our Admin interface on our Website uses a combination of HTML5, CSS3, JS and PHP to allow an Employer to see a list of all of the employees, create/remove employee accounts, create/add Menu Items and view charts and stats unique to their business. All passwords are Hashed before they are stored on the database using PHP, so both the hash and unique salt are stored on the database.

This business activity model visualises the steps taken by the company staff when using the app.

## Problems and Resolution

### WiFi P2P

After our initial design and research we intended to use android's native WiFi P2P library, that would allow us to be able to send data between two devices that are connected by a Local Area Network, this can also be achieved by using a mobile devices ability to create a hotspot, which would act as the Local Area Network. The issues we encountered was that the WiFi P2P library is a recent addition to the android framework and was previously called Android Beam meaning that only devices from API level 14 or higher would be capable of using the service. 

Another issue we came across was that the P2P services acts similarly to a bluetooth connection as it uses WPS for security and as a result needs the user to hit accept for each file transfer.

Another significant issue was that once two devices were connected, one device would become the group owner and would act as the server while the rest would act as clients. The problem was that the group owner was only able to receive files and to become the group owner, you would have to disconnect and reconnect, meaning the user would have to accept the connection again which wasn't practical as if a waitress wanted to send an order to the kitchen, she could but then to get any updates on the status of the order, the waitress would have to accept the connection from the kitchen each time they wanted to change the order status. 

Lastly disconnecting from a group was not very consistent as the group was only destroyed after the group owner disconnected and the connection timeout was reached. This meant that users would may have tried to disconnect to an empty group while the other user may create a new group or their Status would change from available to either busy and wouldn't be able to be found by the searching devices.

Our solution to these issues was to try an alternative method, which resulted in the application requiring an Internet connection to be able to function. We used the HTTP POST request to run PHP files on a server that would handle accessing and storing all our data on a MYSQL Server. 

### General App Functionality Problems

***Navigation problem*** --- Near the start of creating the app layout we had significant issues with navigating the layout of the app. This was initially solved by using two of the default android activities together. The 'master/detail flow ' and 'navigation drawer' together to solve this. This allowed us to set up a menu list and its details and have a navigation drawer for later pages. However this brought with it the use of fragments and recycler view adapters which, at the time, proved difficult to understand and made finding out what each of the classes and how they interacted challenging. The fragments became easier to follow after significant time studying the android API and numerous online tutorials. This in turn allowed us to create more fragments and activities for pages such as the table list and the order pages.

***Adding items to an order*** --- With the addition of new fragments and activities for tables lists and for the order, a new problem was how to add items to an empty order. This was solved by creating new content lists which created new list items to add an item and referencing them in the menu list and detail activities.
When a menu item is clicked, the name of that item is saved as a string. When the Add Item button is clicked in the menu detail fragments, a new order item is created with the name in the string and set at the correct position.

***Received orders*** --- One of the last issues we had was creating order details and including a function to remove orders from the received orders list. The order details were solved by creating new layouts, separate from the menu detail layouts, for the order details and calling them instead. The remove order problem was solved by calling another Async task that runs in the background which calls the server. The server then changes the status of the order form open to close and then notifies the app.

## Known, Unresolved Bugs

### Android Application
1. An Internet connection is required to use the app, could be solved by using hotspots and caching menu items, but it requires an Internet connection to update cache.
2. If you have a connection and input the wrong username or password, it will print the "Oops! Something went wrong, check your connection" instead of printing the correct "Incorrect username or password".
3. The price, table number and Person who created the order are not being sent or stored in the database with the current version of the application due to time constraints and as a result the price of each order, the table number the order came from and who sent the order are not accessible in received orders.
4. When in the Item detail view, it will only display the first 15 characters of a menu item, pending the size of your device.
5. If you rotate the screen, the Item name will revert back to the default "Food Description".
6. When you add multiple orders in a session, the Menu item number to the left of the menu item name, when on the total/current order will keep increasing and not reset correctly until the application is closed or you log out.
7.  After sending an order, to get back to the home screen to be able to view the received orders, you have to press back multiple times to go back through the total order,then menu, then table list, then back to the home screen.
8.  Received orders currently only display the order number, which is a string representation of dd/mm/yyyy/hh/mm/ss as a result of Bug 3, mentioned above.
9.  When you press the remove/complete order button, it doesn't yet return you to the list of received orders
10.  There is no check or login status for accounts which means you can login on all devices using one account. 
11. Pressing the back button in the top left while in menu details send you back to the table list instead of the menu list. Pressing back on your phone sends you back to the main menu.
12. Viewing received orders may inexplicably cause the app to crash.

### Website
1. When using the Website on a mobile device and you press the menu button to drop down the navbar, it pushes down the Text.
2. When logging in on a mobile device, the close button for the login modal is pushed to a new line.
3. On a mobile device, the sidebar on the employer admin page won't display.
4. If you try to remove an employee and input either the wrong PPS number or wrong name, it won't give an error message and nothing will happen, this is also the case for removing a menu item. 
5. Item price will accept a string.
